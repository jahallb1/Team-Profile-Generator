  ## Description
   AS A manager
   I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
   SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
   
   GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
   WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
   THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input
   WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
   THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address
   WHEN I click on the GitHub username
   THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
   WHEN I start the application
   THEN I am prompted to enter the team manager’s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
